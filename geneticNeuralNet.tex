\section{Introduction}
Genetic neural networks (GNNs) are learning algorithms that use neural networks to associate an input with an output. Miller et al were some of the first researchers to train neural networks with genetic algorithms\cite{MillerToddHedge}. Rather than backpropagation, which determines the weights and biases within the network using partial derivatives, GNNs mutate the weights and biases randomly in a population of networks over many generations.

More recent implementations allow for the structure of the network to mutate\cite{LamStructure}.
